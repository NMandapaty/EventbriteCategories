# EventbriteCategories
My solution for the Eventbrite coding challenge to "Create a Django App that 
presents a user with a set of categories and asks for the top 3 categories of 
events theyâ€™re interested in. Once they have selected their choices, use the 
Eventbrite API to gather relevant events and display them on a page. The results 
page should support pagination"
